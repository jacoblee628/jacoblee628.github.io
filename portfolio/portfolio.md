### 11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning (CMU)
Did a lot of stuff for the [11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning](http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F20/index.html) course at CMU.

#### Homeworks

<a href="http://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F20/document/homework/Homework_1_1.pdf"><img src="../assets/images/hw1p1.png" width="500"/></a>

**Description:**

* Wrote four homework assignments for the course:
    * hw1: Recreating [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and automatic differentiation
        * This took a lot of work - writeup is 30 pages long, with lots of illustrations and examples
    * hw1bonus: Adam, Dropout, and BatchNorm
    * hw2: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
    * hw2bonus: 2d Convolutional Networks
* on recreating the deep learning software  from scratch, using only NumPy and Python
* Covers automatic differentiation, backpropagation, loss functions, and basic neural network components.

**Description:**

Gave two recitation lectures:
* 'Bootcamp' on the first homework
* Matrix calculus and backpropagation

If I sound tired, it's because class was at 8am :(

#### Misc

I also answered 3400 student questions on Piazza, more than the professor :)

<!-- ## Speech-to-Text with Listen Attend Spell

Trained a network that converts input audio directly to text. Implemented [Listen Attend Spell (Chan et al, 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01211) using only PyTorch, trained on AWS. Placed #17 of 278 students in the course.

## Word Prediction with the AWD-LSTM

Trained a network that generates text. Implemented the heavily regularized [AWD-LSTM (Merity et al, 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02182), manually implementing regularization methods such as Locked Dropout, Embedding Dropout, and Weight Tying.

## Machine Learning from Scratch

Implemented a variety of ML/DL algorithms from scratch. Optimizers, network architectures, search algorithms, and more. -->
