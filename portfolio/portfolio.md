## Social Distancing Detection
![SD Detection Example by Landing AI](https://i2.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-51.png?w=1158&ssl=1)

Above: Similar product by [Landing AI](https://syncedreview.com/2020/04/20/landing-ai-social-distancing-detector-monitors-workplaces/).

During my last internship, I built a system that tracks various metrics related to social distancing in retail spaces. It was based on computer vision-generated trajectories.

## Trajectory Compression
![Trajectory](https://irc.atr.jp/sets/approach_robot/trajectory_Other.png)

I also researched, selected, and implemented a state-of-the-art trajectory compression algorithm.

For our applications it was projected to compress trajectories up to 15x, while also removing noise from the data.

## Speech Transcription

Trained a neural network that converts input audio directly to text for the Intro to DL course at CMU.

Based on transcription accuracy (with no misc error correction systems), placed #17 of 278 students in the course.

Implemented [Listen Attend Spell (Chan et al, 2015)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01211) from scratch with PyTorch, trained on AWS.
